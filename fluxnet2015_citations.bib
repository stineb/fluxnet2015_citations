abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}OzFlux is the regional Australian and New Zealand flux tower network that aims to provide a continental-scale national research facility to monitor and assess trends, and improve predictions, of Australia's terrestrial biosphere and climate. This paper describes the evolution, design and current status of OzFlux as well as an overview of data processing. We analyse measurements from the Australian portion of the OzFlux network and found that the response of Australian biomes to climate was largely consistent with global studies but that Australian systems had a lower ecosystem water-use efficiency. Australian semi-arid/arid ecosystems are important because of their huge extent (70 {\%}) and they have evolved with common moisture limitations. We also found that Australian ecosystems had similar radiation use efficiency per unit leaf area compared to global values that indicates a convergence toward a similar biochemical efficiency. The paper discusses the utility of the flux data and the synergies between flux, remote sensing and modelling. Lastly, the paper looks ahead at the future direction of the network and concludes that there has been a substantial contribution by OzFlux and considerable opportunities remain to further advance our understanding of ecosystem response to disturbances including drought, fire, land use and land cover change, land management and climate change that are relevant both nationally and internationally. It is suggested that a synergistic approach is required to address all of the spatial, ecological, human and cultural challenges of managing the delicately balanced ecosystems in Australia.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The importance of ecological management for reducing the vulnerability of biodiversity to climate change is increasingly recognized, yet frameworks to facilitate a structured approach to climate adaptation management are lacking. We developed a conceptual framework that can guide identification of climate change impacts and adaptive management options in a given region or biome. The framework focuses on potential points of early climate change impact, and organizes these along two main axes. First, it recognizes that climate change can act at a range of ecological scales. Secondly, it emphasizes that outcomes are dependent on two potentially interacting and countervailing forces: (1) changes to environmental parameters and ecological processes brought about by climate change, and (2) responses of component systems as determined by attributes of resistance and resilience. Through this structure, the framework draws together a broad range of ecological concepts, with a novel emphasis on attributes of resistance and resilience that can temper the response of species, ecosystems and landscapes to climate change. We applied the framework to the world's largest remaining Mediterranean-climate woodland, the 'Great Western Woodlands' of south-western Australia. In this relatively intact region, maintaining inherent resistance and resilience by preventing anthropogenic degradation is of highest priority and lowest risk. Limited, higher risk options such as fire management, protection of refugia and translocation of adaptive genes may be justifiable under more extreme change, hence our capacity to predict the extent of change strongly impinges on such management decisions. These conclusions may contrast with similar analyses in degraded landscapes, where natural integrity is already compromised, and existing investment in restoration may facilitate experimentation with higher risk options.},

abstract = {Global carbon balances are increasingly affected by large fluctuations in productivity occurring throughout semiarid regions. Recent analyses found a large C uptake anomaly in 2011 in arid and semiarid regions of the southern hemisphere. Consequently, we compared C and water fluxes of two distinct woody ecosystems (a Mulga (Acacia) woodland and a Corymbia savanna) between August 2012 and August 2014 in semiarid central Australia, demonstrating that the 2011 anomaly was short-lived in both ecosystems. The Mulga woodland was approximately C neutral but with periods of significant uptake within both years. The extreme drought tolerance of Acacia is presumed to have contributed to this. By contrast, the Corymbia savanna was a very large net C source (130 and 200gCm-2yr-1in average and below average rainfall years, respectively), which is likely to have been a consequence of the degradation of standing, senescent biomass that was a legacy of high productivity during the 2011 anomaly. The magnitude and temporal patterns in ecosystem water-use efficiencies (WUE), derived from eddy covariance data, differed across the two sites, which may reflect differences in the relative contributions of respiration to net C fluxes across the two ecosystems. In contrast, differences in leaf-scale measures of WUE, derived from13C stable isotope analyses, were apparent at small spatial scales and may reflect the different rooting strategies of Corymbia and Acacia trees within the Corymbia savanna. Restrictions on root growth and infiltration by a siliceous hardpan located below Acacia, whether in the Mulga woodland or in small Mulga patches of the Corymbia savanna, impedes drainage of water to depth, thereby producing a reservoir for soil moisture storage under Acacia while acting as a barrier to access of groundwater by Corymbia trees in Mulga patches, but not in the open Corymbia savanna.},

	abstract = {Forest ecosystems play a crucial role in the global carbon cycle by sequestering a considerable fraction of anthropogenic CO2, thereby contributing to climate change mitigation. However, there is a gap in our understanding about the carbon dynamics of eucalypt (broadleaf evergreen) forests in temperate climates, which might differ from temperate evergreen coniferous or deciduous broadleaved forests given their fundamental differences in physiology, phenology and growth dynamics. To address this gap we undertook a 3-year study (2010‚Äì2012) of eddy covariance measurements in a dry temperate eucalypt forest in southeastern Australia. We determined the annual net carbon balance and investigated the temporal (seasonal and inter-annual) variability in and environmental controls of net ecosystem carbon exchange (NEE), gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER). The forest was a large and constant carbon sink throughout the study period, even in winter, with an overall mean NEE of ‚àí1234 ¬± 109 (SE) g C m‚àí2 yr‚àí1. Estimated annual ER was similar for 2010 and 2011 but decreased in 2012 ranging from 1603 to 1346 g C m‚àí2 yr‚àí1, whereas GPP showed no significant inter-annual variability, with a mean annual estimate of 2728 ¬± 39 g C m‚àí2 yr‚àí1. All ecosystem carbon fluxes had a pronounced seasonality, with GPP being greatest during spring and summer and ER being highest during summer, whereas peaks in NEE occurred in early spring and again in summer. High NEE in spring was likely caused by a delayed increase in ER due to low temperatures. A strong seasonal pattern in environmental controls of daytime and night-time NEE was revealed. Daytime NEE was equally explained by incoming solar radiation and air temperature, whereas air temperature was the main environmental driver of night-time NEE. The forest experienced unusual above-average annual rainfall during the first 2 years of this 3-year period so that soil water content remained relatively high and the forest was not water limited. Our results show the potential of temperate eucalypt forests to sequester large amounts of carbon when not water limited. However, further studies using bottom-up approaches are needed to validate measurements from the eddy covariance flux tower and to account for a possible underestimation in ER due to advection fluxes.},

abstract = {Old-growth forests can accumulate carbon. However, what controls the rate of net carbon accumulation in those old-growth forests is still poorly understood. Using eddy flux measurements from two old-growth evergreen broadleaf forests (subtropical forest and tropical forest) in southern China, we compared the seasonal and inter-annual variations in the carbon fluxes of those two forests and quantified the major drivers for these temporal variations. The measured flux data showed that the annual net carbon uptake of the subtropical forest was generally much larger than that for the tropical forest. The mean net ecosystem exchange (NEE) over 6 years was -397¬±94gCm-2yr-1for the subtropical forest and -166¬±49gCm-2yr-1for the tropical forest with different seasonal variations. The subtropical forest was a carbon sink for most months in a year, while the tropical forest was a carbon source in wet seasons (positive NEE) and a carbon sink in dry seasons (negative NEE). Both forests were stronger carbon sink in dry years, because of much larger reduction in ER than in wet years. At the seasonal scale, GPP in wet seasons was 37.1{\%} higher than that for dry seasons in the subtropical forest, and was only 12.4{\%} higher in the tropical forest. The amplitude of seasonal GPP variation in the tropical forest was much weaker than in the subtropical forest, but the amplitude of the seasonal variation in ER was much larger than in the subtropical forest. The seasonal variation in NEE was largely driven by the variation in monthly ER of the tropical forest, and by both seasonal variations in monthly GPP and ER of the subtropical forest. At inter-annual scale, annual NEE varied tightly with annual rainfall from year to year. Therefore annual rainfall was suggested a fundamental driver of annual carbon sequestration in the subtropical and tropical forests in southern China. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The behavior of whole ecosystems in humid climate zone in response to drought is less well documented. Continuous measurements of carbon dioxide and water vapor exchange using the eddy covariance technique during 2003-2007 were made above a subtropical evergreen coniferous plantation in Southeast China. Seasonal distribution of precipitation and temperature was inconsistent during the summer, which resulted in droughts frequently. Gross ecosystem photosynthesis (GEP), ecosystem respiration (RE) and net ecosystem production (NEP) showed clear seasonality, with low rates during droughts and in winter. With statistical significance, the monthly GEP and RE increased exponentially with air temperature, but the monthly NEP was less sensitive and only increased linearly with air temperature. However, the function response of monthly NEP and its components (GEP and RE) disappeared under high temperature and low soil moisture. Monthly and yearly RE showed a statistically linear and positive dependence on the corresponding GEP. Annual NEP varied among years from 306 to 430 g C m(-2) (mean 395, SD 50). Interannual variability in NEP was controlled primarily by air temperature and the ratio of precipitation and evapotranspiration that affected the RE/GEP ratio, which varied between 0.76 and 0.81 (mean 0.78, SD 0.02).},

abstract = {Quantifying the surface energy fluxes of grazed and ungrazed steppes is essential to understand the roles of grasslands in local and global climate and in land use change. We used paired eddy-covariance towers to investigate the effects of grazing on energy balance (EB) components: net radiation (Rn), latent heat (LE), sensible heat (H), and soil heat (G) fluxes on adjacent grazed and ungrazed areas in a desert steppe of the Mongolian Plateau for a two-year period (2010‚Äì2012). Near 95{\%} of Rn was partitioned as LE and H, whereas the contributions of G and other components of the EB were 5{\%} at an annual scale. H dominated the energy partitioning and shared {\~{}}50{\%} of Rn. When comparing the grazed and the ungrazed desert steppe, there was remarkably lower Rn and a lower H, but higher G at the grazed site than at the ungrazed site. Both reduced available energy (Rn ‚àí G) and H indicated a ‚Äúcooling effect‚Äù feedback onto the local climate through grazing. Grazing reduced the dry year LE but enhanced the wet year LE. Energy partitioning of LE/Rn was positively correlated with the canopy conductivity, leaf area index, and soil moisture. H/Rn was positively correlated with the vapor pressure deficit but negatively correlated with the soil moisture. Boosted regression tree results showed that LE/Rn was dominated by soil moisture in both years and at both sites, while grazing shifted the H/Rn domination from temperature to soil moisture in the wet year. Grazing not only caused an LE shift between the dry and the wet year, but also triggered a decrease in the H/Rn because of changes in vegetation and soil properties, indicating that the ungrazed area had a greater resistance while the grazed area had a greater sensitivity of EB components to the changing climate.},

abstract = {Post-fire salvage logging is a common silvicultural practice around the world, with the potential to alter the regenerative capacity of an ecosystem and thus its role as a source or a sink of carbon. However, there is no information on the effect of burnt wood management on the net ecosystem carbon balance. Here, we examine for the first time the effect of post-fire burnt wood management on the net ecosystem carbon balance by comparing the carbon exchange of two treatments in a burnt Mediterranean coniferous forest treated by salvage logging (SL, felling and removing the logs and masticating the woody debris) and Non-Intervention (NI, all trees left standing) using eddy covariance measurements. Using different partitioning approaches, we analyze the evolution of photosynthesis and respiration processes together with measurements of vegetation cover and soil respiration and humidity to interpret the differences in the measured fluxes and underlying processes. Results show that SL enhanced CO2emissions of this burnt pine forest by more than 120gCm-2compared to the NI treatment for the period June-December 2009. Although soil respiration was around 30{\%} higher in NI during growing season, this was more than offset by photosynthesis, as corroborated by increases in vegetation cover and evapotranspiration. Since SL is counterproductive to climate-change and Kyoto protocol objectives of optimal C sequestration by terrestrial ecosystems, less aggressive burnt wood management policies should be considered. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Forests in Mediterranean Europe are located in a hot spot for tropospheric ozone formation. We applied two canopy-level stomatal conductance models (Jarvis-type and Ball-Woodrow-Berry models) to two Mediterranean evergreen forests (Umbrella pine at San Rossore, and Holm oak at Castelporziano, in central Italy), which is essential for assessing ozone impact on forests via the stomatal flux-based approach. Parameterizations of the models was carried out by the Eddy Covariance technique. Both Jarvis-type and Ball-Woodrow-Berry models well explained the observed stomatal conductance and stomatal ozone flux in both forests. Maximum stomatal conductance was 72{\%} higher in Umbrella pine than in Holm oak, leading to higher stomatal ozone flux. Inclusion of a soil water function improved the performance of the Jarvis-type model for the estimation of stomatal ozone flux. We found contrasting results concerning the coefficient m (the slope of the photosynthesis-stomatal conductance relationship) in the Ball-Woodrow-Berry model between the two forests: while m was constant for varying soil water status in the Holm oak forest, it declined with soil drying in the Umbrella pine forest. This may result from higher stomatal sensitivity to drought in Umbrella pine as a response to avoid drought stress. Overall, these results advance our understanding of ozone risk assessment in Mediterranean forests.},

	abstract = {Annual precipitation in the central and southern warm-desert region of North America is distributed climatologically between summer and winter periods with two prominent dry periods between them. We used energy and carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes from eddy covariance along with standard meteorological and soil moisture measurements at a semiarid savanna in southern Arizona, United States, to better understand the consequences of warm or cool season drought on ecosystem CO2 exchange in these bimodally forced water-limited regions. Over the last 100 years, this historic grassland has converted to a savanna by the encroachment of the native mesquite tree (Prosopis velutina Woot.). During each of the 4 years of observation (2004‚Äì2007), annual precipitation (P) was below average, but monsoon (July‚ÄìSeptember) P was both above and below average while cool-season (December‚ÄìMarch) P was always less than average by varying degrees. The ecosystem was a net source of CO2 to the atmosphere, ranging from 14 to 95 g C m‚àí2 yr‚àí1 with the strength of the source increasing with decreasing precipitation. When the rainfall was closest to the long-term average in its distribution and amount, the ecosystem was essentially carbon neutral. Summer drought resulted in increased carbon losses due mainly to a shortening of the growing season and the length of time later in the season when photosynthetic gain exceeds respiration loss. Severe cool season drought led to decreased spring carbon uptake and seemingly enhanced summer respiration, resulting in conditions that led to the greatest annual net carbon loss.},

	abstract = {We analyzed 13 years (1992‚àí2004) of CO2 flux data, biometry, and meteorology from a mixed deciduous forest in central Massachusetts. Annual net uptake of CO2 ranged from 1.0 to 4.7 Mg-C ha‚àí1yr‚àí1, with an average of 2.5 Mg-C ha‚àí1yr‚àí1. Uptake rates increased systematically, nearly doubling over the period despite forest age of 75‚Äì110 years; there were parallel increases in midsummer photosynthetic capacity at high light level (21.5‚àí31.5 Œºmole m‚àí2s‚àí1), woody biomass (101‚àí115 Mg-C ha‚àí1 from 1993‚àí2005, mostly due to growth of one species, red oak), and peak leaf area index (4.5‚àí5.5 from 1998‚Äì2005). The long-term trends were interrupted in 1998 by sharp declines in photosynthetic capacity, net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2, and other parameters, with recovery over the next 3 years. The observations were compared to empirical functions giving the mean responses to temperature and light, and to a terrestrial ecosystem model (IBIS2). Variations in gross ecosystem exchange of CO2 (GEE) and NEE on hourly to monthly timescales were represented well as prompt responses to the environment, but interannual variations and long-term trends were not. IBIS2 simulated mean annual NEE, but greatly overpredicted the amplitude of the seasonal cycle and did not predict the decadal trend. The drivers of interannual and decadal changes in NEE are long-term increases in tree biomass, successional change in forest composition, and disturbance events, processes not well represented in current models.},

	abstract = {The role and relative importance of weather and cutting for the seasonal and inter-annual variability of the net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) of a temperate mountain grassland was investigated. Eddy covariance CO2 flux data and associated measurements of the green plant area index and the major environmental driving forces acquired during 2001‚Äì2006 at the study site Neustift (Austria) were analyzed. Driven by three cutting events per year which kept the investigated grassland in a stage of vigorous growth, the seasonal variability of NEE was primarily modulated by gross primary productivity (GPP). The role of environmental parameters in modulating the seasonal variability of NEE was obscured by the strong response of GPP to changes in the amount of green plant area, as well as the cutting-mediated decoupling of phenological development and the seasonal course of environmental drivers. None of the environmental and management metrics examined was able to explain the inter-annual variability of annual NEE. This is thought to result from (1) a high covariance between GPP and ecosystem respiration (Reco) at the annual timescale which results in a comparatively small inter-annual variation of NEE, (2) compensating effects between carbon exchange during and outside the management period, and (3) changes in the biotic response to rather than the environmental variables per se. GPP was more important in modulating inter-annual variations in NEE in spring and before the first and second cut, while Reco explained a larger fraction of the inter-annual variability of NEE during the remaining periods, in particular the post-cut periods.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT At Tharandt/Germany eddy covariance (EC) measurements of carbon dioxide and heat fluxes are performed above an old spruce forest since 1996. The last ten years cover almost all meteorological extremes observed during the last 45 years: the coldest and warmest year with mean air temperature of 6.1¬∞C (1996) and 9.6¬∞C (2000) as well as the fourth wettest and the driest year with a precipitation of 1098 mm (2002) and 501 mm (2003), respectively. In general, the observed annual carbon net ecosystem exchange (NEE) indicates a high net sink from ‚àí395 g C m‚àí2 a‚àí1 (2003) to ‚àí698 g C m‚àí2 a‚àí1 (1999) with a coefficient of variation cv= 16.6\%. The yearly evapotranspiration (ET) has a lower interannual variability (cv= 9.5\%) between 389 mm (2003) and 537 mm (2000). The influence of flux correction and gap filling on the amount of annual NEE and ET is considerable. Using different methods of gap filling (non-linear regressions, mean diurnal courses) yields annual NEE totals that differ by up to 18\%. Consistency analysis regarding energy balance closure, comparisons with independent soil respiration and biomass increment measurements indicate reliability of the fluxes. The average gap of the energy balance is 15\% of the available energy based on regression slope with an intercept of 3 to 16 W m‚àí2, but around zero for annual flux ratios. Between 47\% and 63\% of the net ecosystem productivity was fixed above ground according to up-scaled tree ring data and forest inventories, respectively. Chamber measurements of soil respiration yield up to 90\% of nighttime EC based total ecosystem respiration. Thus, we conclude that the EC based flux represents an upper limit of the C sink at the site.},

	abstract = {A new method is proposed for the computation of CO2 Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) and its components in a forest ecosystem. Advective flux is estimated by taking into account the air mass conservation principle. For this purpose, wind and dry air density values on the surface of the control volume are first corrected and then the advective flux is estimated on the surface of the control volume. Turbulent flux is also computed along the surface of the control volume while storage flux is computed inside the volume. Additional characteristics of this method are that incompressibility of the mean flow is not assumed a priori, and that vertical and horizontal advective fluxes are not treated separately, but their sum is estimated directly. The methodology is applied to experimental data collected with a three-dimensional scheme at the alpine site of Renon during the Advex project (July 2005). The advection flux was found to be prevailing positive at night and negative during the day, as was found in previous studies on advection for the same site, but showed a lower scatter in half-hour calculated values. We tested the effect of its summation on turbulent and storage fluxes to produce half-hourly values of NEE. Nighttime NEE values were used in functional relations with soil temperature, daytime values with PPFD. The effect of addition of the advection component was an increase in the values of parameters indicating ecosystem respiration, quantum yield, and photosynthetic capacity. The coefficient of correlation between NEE and environmental drivers increased.},

	abstract = {Global warming may intensify the hydrological cycle and lead to increased drought severity and duration, which could alter plant community structure and subsequent ecosystem water and carbon dioxide cycling. We report on the net ecosystem exchange of carbon dioxide (NEE) of a semidesert grassland through a severe drought which drove succession from native bunchgrasses to forbs and to eventual dominance by an exotic bunchgrass. We monitored NEE and energy fluxes using eddy covariance coupled with meteorological and soil moisture variables for 6 years at a grassland site in southeastern Arizona, USA. Seasonal NEE typically showed a springtime carbon uptake after winter-spring periods of average rainfall followed by much stronger sink activity during the summer rainy season. The two severe drought years (2004 and 2005) resulted in a net release of carbon dioxide (25 g C m‚àí2) and widespread mortality of native perennial bunchgrasses. Above average summer rains in 2006 alleviated drought conditions, resulting in a large flush of broad-leaved forbs and negative total NEE (‚àí55 g C m‚àí2 year‚àí1). Starting in 2007 and continuing through 2009, the ecosystem became increasingly dominated by the exotic grass, Eragrostis lehmanniana, and was a net carbon sink (‚àí47 to ‚àí98 g C m‚àí2 year‚àí1) but with distinct annual patterns in NEE. Rainfall mediated by soils was the key driver to water and carbon fluxes. Seasonal respiration and photosynthesis were strongly dependent on precipitation, but photosynthesis was more sensitive to rainfall variation. Respiration normalized by evapotranspiration showed no interannual variation, while normalized gross ecosystem production (i.e., water use efficiency) was low during drought years and then increased as the rains returned and the E. lehmanniana invasion progressed. Thus, when dry summer conditions returned in 2009, the potential for ecosystem carbon accumulation was increased and the ecosystem remained a net sink unlike similar dry years when native grasses dominated ecosystem structure.},

	abstract = {The net exchanges of carbon dioxide, water vapor, and energy were examined in a perennial Colorado Plateau grassland for 5 years. The study began within a multiyear drought and continued as the drought ended. The grassland is located near the northern boundary of the influence of the North American monsoon, a major climatic feature bringing summer rain. Following rain, evapotranspiration peaked above 8 mm d‚àí1 but was usually much smaller (2‚Äì4 mm d‚àí1). Net productivity of the grassland was low compared to other ecosystems, with peak hourly net CO2 uptake in the spring of 4 Œºmol m‚àí2 s‚àí1 and springtime carbon gain in the range of 42 ¬± 11 g C m‚àí2 (based on fluxes) to 72 ¬± 55 g C m‚àí2 (based on carbon stocks; annual carbon gain was not quantified). Drought decreased gross ecosystem productivity (GEP) and total ecosystem respiration, with a much larger GEP decrease. Monsoon rains led to respiratory pulses, lasting a few days at most, and only rarely resulted in net CO2 gain, despite the fact that C4 grasses dominated plant cover. Minor CO2 uptake was observed in fall following rain. Spring CO2 uptake was regulated by deep soil moisture, which depended on precipitation in the prior fall and winter. The lack of CO2 uptake during the monsoon and the dependence of GEP on deep soil moisture are in contrast with arid grasslands of the warm deserts. Cold desert grasslands are most likely to be impacted by future changes in winter and not summer precipitation.},
