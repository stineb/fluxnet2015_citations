# fluxnet2015_citations

This repository holds the collection of citation information used for FLUXNET 2015 Tier 1 data and tools to generate a table with LaTeX citation keys. This is based on data kindly provided by Chongya Jiang (chongya.jiang@gmail.com) and complemented by Benjamin Stocker (b.stocker@creaf.uab.cat).

A public google doc holding the same table is available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dPa8MByOTeRhf-2lbfW-Vaf2CcJU87kMmP3yWF2Ple4/edit?usp=sharing). This uses the Paperpile add-on to manage citations. 

**Note: This is not an official data and code resource, but is the result of an individual effort. Use with care. No guarantee and responsibility given for correctness of data!**

Files:

- `fluxnet2015_citations.bib`: Bibtex file with citation information.
- `siteinfo_citations.csv`: Sites data table without citation key.
- `get_citations.R`: R script to complement table with LaTeX citation keys. VERY MUCH UNDER CONSTRUCTION!
